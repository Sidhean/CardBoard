Text-based cards! At least- thats the idea. Bulding from the humble Card to the less humble Board, this contains everything you need to manually play cards. On top of this, one can add (as, indeed, I plan to):  
  -rulebooks to change default settings  
  -scripts to play simple games  
  -custom classes to cater to crazy cardgames
